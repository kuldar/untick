# Untick

Small Chrome extension to hide all the stupid checkmarks on Twitter. The "official" extension is pending for a review, but it's simple to just download this repo and install the extension manually.

## Manual installation

- Visit chrome://extensions (via omnibox or menu -> Tools -> Extensions)
- Enable Developer mode by ticking the checkbox in the upper-right corner
- Click on the "Load unpacked extension..." button
- Select the directory containing the unzipped repo/extension
